# A2: Divergent Design

## A1 Opportunity

+ **Online to Offline:** An application focused on transitioning online connections into offline relationships 
    - **Jay’s Interview:** While browsing Facebook, Jay saw that his first girlfriend would be visiting San Diego, and he reached out to plan a meet up. He discovers his coworker plays in a band in the same way, and he makes plans to attend her performance. Jay’s anecdotes broadly involve harnessing social media to plan intentional, in-person interactions with new and old friends. 
    - **Bryson’s Interview:** Bryson invited his subscribers to DM him on Instagram, and as he communicated with them, he discovered how lonely they felt. After his breakup, Bryson experienced how that loneliness telescoped into hate, remarking that social media users live so vicariously through influencers that they neglect to live their own life. He hopes his subscribers can not only find community with him, but with each other. 
    - Jay and Bryson are personable and outgoing by trade, so they transitioned online interactions offline and parasocial interactions into social ones with relative ease. However, as Bryson discovered, not everyone is wired that way. A platform dedicated to transitioning online interactions offline can take the pressure off phrasing an invitation to hang out with someone new (like Bryson’s subscribers) or rekindle an old connection (like Jay’s ex-girlfriend). 

## Value, Audience, Name

+ **Value:** Importantly, the app’s primary purpose is not to connect users with new IRL friends. Instead, users bring their existing networks to the platform and use it to make offline connections with online or distant friends. A platform dedicated to transitioning online relationships (e.g., members of the same online community, distant friends that still follow each other, internet mutuals, etc.) offline takes the pressure off making plans to connect with someone different.  
    - While mustering up the courage to ask someone new to hang out, each logistic detail becomes a source of worry: “Will they like what I have planned?”, “Are they going to be free?”, “Who pays?”, “Will they say ‘yes’?” The app aims to eliminate all of these uncertainties besides the last one, and even then, it can soften the blow of a rejected invite (see Hinge in digital scrapbook), lowering inhibitions associated with asking. 
+ **Audience:** This app’s target demographic has a disproportionate abundance of online relationships and a desire for offline connections. When people graduate college or high school, people often join online communities or even enter parasocial relationships with online influencers to supplement their social lives, especially when that disconnect is compounded with living alone. This app is targeted towards recent graduates, people who experience the sudden loss of one or multiple social networks and supplant them with online equivalents. 
+ **Name:** Quest (short form for request, also like being invited to go on a quest, something along those lines...)

## Digital Scrapbook

### Precedents

“Predictable” places to look, but a good starting point.

+ **Find a Friend Services:** While the app’s purpose is not to connect users to new IRL friends, platforms that offer this service could include features that make it easier to make offline plans.  
+ **Dating Apps:** People are generally nervous to ask someone to go on a date, or even express romantic interest. Using a dating app assuages those nerves, arguably to a fault. I can try to replicate this effect by observing user interactions with dating apps.

## Potential Features

### Managing Connections
1. **Circles:** You can group their connections into circles however you choose. Features that rely on this system of organization assume that members in the same circle have the same proximity to the user (e.g., family, close friends, coworkers). 
2. **Reserved Spots:** Allocate spots in recommended share window for connections from specific circles (e.g., when a user tries to share an activity, they will see x family members, y close friends, etc.).  
3. **Open Hangouts:** You can mass invite every person in selected circle(s) to an activity and set a cap on the number of people there’s space for. Once enough people commit, the invitation disappears. 
4. **Prioritize Acceptance:** When sending an invite, users can queue people they want to do an activity with, in priority order. If the first person in the queue rejects the invite, it is automatically sent to the next person, and so on. 
5. **Groups (bidirectional):** Only you can see your circles and who is a part of each one. Groups are bidirectional; every member in a group knows who else is in the group, too. Groups will appear together in recommended share. 
6. **Link In Bio:** Connect with others via links in bio on other social media platforms. The link would take you to their profile in-app, where you can request to connect with them. Once they accept, you can add them to your circles and send them invites. 
7. **Creator Managed:** Content creators can invite followers to join a Creator Circle on the app, where members can see each other’s profiles. Users would have to request to connect with people in the same Creator Circle, but they can see which profiles are within a certain distance of them. 

### "Will they like what I have planned?"
8. **Pinned Activities:** Pin favorite and wish list activities to your profile. Interact with other users’ pinned activities to send them an invite somewhere they like or want to go. 
9. **Feed:** You can scroll through a feed of activities including things to do in your area (e.g. flea markets, parks, restaurants, etc.) and at home (e.g. make a viral recipe, play a board game, etc.) and send invitations to do them with friends. You can also save activities to personal collections or pin them on a Favorites or Wishlist section in your profile. 
10. **Share Recommendation:** When you interact with an activity to send an invitation, the app will recommend other users who are most interested in that activity. A user likely to be recommended would have saved that activity to a personal collection or pinned it on their profile, or they would have sent and accepted invitations to similar activities. 

### "Are they going to be free?"
11. **Calendar Sync:** Sync events from you other calendar app(s). You can see details about each synced event on your profile, but other users cannot. To other users, free and blocked time look like colored slots, without the event names, attendees, and other details visible to you only. When you accept an invitation, the commitment will sync back up to your preferred calendar(s). 
12. **Blocked Time:** You can designate certain windows as “hard commitments” (other users cannot send you invites within that window) and “soft commitments” (other users can see you might be busy, but they are free to send you invites). You can select these windows manually or convert synced events into hard and soft commitments. Accepted invitations are automatically hard commitments, you cannot use the app to schedule over them. 
13. **Free Time:** You can designate certain windows as “free time,” and make that designation visible to specific circles only. Free time windows won’t appear blocked to other users, but knowing you are free could empower people in selected circles to send invites. 

### "Who pays?"
14. **Who’s bringing what:** Activities can require various supplies (e.g., picnic, painting day, etc.). AI can generate a list of them, and you can select the ones to include in your invite and the ones you’re bringing. To accept your invite, recipients must commit to bringing something, too. 
15. **Who’s paying:** You can optionally commit to paying or explicitly request splitting the bill in your invite. If you are splitting, and one or a few people pay for the group, use the app to automatically compute and request the amount owed from each person on their preferred Cash App platform. 

### "Are they going to say yes?"
16. **Disappearing Invitations:** When you send an invitation, it disappears immediately after, so you don’t have time to overthink what you just sent. If the recipient accepts, it’ll appear in your calendar. If not, nothing happens. You can set the lifespan of your invitation, or how long the recipient has to accept or reschedule. 
17. **Cancellation Policy:** Should you be able to cancel on someone to schedule with someone else during that window? No, once you cancel an activity, that window continues to appear as a “hard commitment” on your end so other users cannot send you invitations. You can still sync an activity from another calendar into that window or manually create one. 
18. **Accepting (Conflicting) Invitations:** You can flip through all the invitations you accumulate. You can accept or decline the invitations as they are or send a rescheduled version back to the person who originally invited you. If any two invitations conflict, the app will present them to you simultaneously. You cannot accept them both as they are. Once you accept an invitation, it becomes a “hard commitment.” 

### Other Logistics
19. **Chat:** Once the recipient(s) accept an invite, a chat is created between all participants to iron out logistics. For example, if someone is running late or needs a ride, they can message in the app. 
20. **Photo Sharing:** Participants can share photos from an activity to the commitment in their calendar. Eventually, those photos will reappear on their feed with a prompt to reprise the activity with those same people. 
21. **Adding to Activity Cards:** After doing a particular activity, you can add a comment or photos of your experience to the activity card that will appear in your connections’ feeds. 


## Value Sensitive Design

**Direct Stakeholders:**
+ Insight: For the application to function as intended, everyone should be active on it. Even extroverts like Jay or Bryson, who may feel silly using a crutch to ask someone new to hang out, should use the app to field requests from people who want to see them. 
    - Design Solution: The app shouldn’t feel like a crutch. It should offer enough of a practical advantage so anyone would rather plan hangouts using this app than other alternatives. Automatically syncing events to and from other calendar apps disguises this app as a planning tool, rather than a resource to lift pressure off phrasing an invitation. 

**National Boundaries** 
+ Insight: In many cultures, it can be seen as disrespectful to refuse an invitation from a friend, especially without offering an explanation or offering to reschedule. 
    - Design Solution: The “rain check” feature allows recipients to send a rescheduled version of their invitation back to the person who invited them, but it can be augmented with an option to include a note. In the note, users can express thanks for the original invitation, and offer a reason related to why they declined. 

**Diverse Geographies**
+ Insight: The activity feeds of someone living in an urban versus rural area would differ greatly. An urbanite would see myriad restaurant and cafe options where someone who lives in a rural area sees...? Consider the extreme case: a person living in relative isolation. What do they see? Who do they invite? 
    - Design Solution: Introduce support for planning virtual activities, like a game of Codenames or Poker or even scheduling a call with a loved one. This prompts questions about what “legitimizes” an online interaction. For example, how is Codenames with a gaming buddy are any more meaningful than the game you usually play? I argue that doing something outside your usual routine, getting to know someone from a different angle, can be as hard to initiate as an offline transition. 

**Indirect Stakeholders, Choose Desired Values**
+ Insight: The app possesses tremendous potential to navigate people towards certain activities or business. Should organizations be able to pay to promote themselves on the app? 
    - Design Solution: Advertising in that way feels sneaky, and that can jade the user into uninstalling it. While brainstorming we discussed gamification – rewarding the user with a discount at a partner establishment for scheduling a commitment. To me, that would cheapen the experience. I believe monetizing a person’s desire to spend time with a friend, in any way, is wrong, so no pay to play either. 

**Reappropriation**
+ Insight: There’s considerable overlap between a dating app and this one. For instance, sending a mutual an invitation to their favorite restaurant, all expenses paid, could double as a first date request. There’s also a lot of creepy behavior on dating apps that feels (unfortunately) anticipated enough there but would be surprising on this platform. 
    - Design Solution: Can only send invites to a widespread list of fixed activities, no custom activity requests. If both people agree to receive romantic invitations from each other, they can unlock those activities and begin sending invitations.

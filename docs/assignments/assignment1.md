# A1: Social Media Needfinding

## Hunch
Relationships on social media are often more parasocial, or even performative, than social in nature. What are better ways to cultivate authentic friendships online?

## Interviewees

**How Jay and Bryson differ from me:**

Meet my awesome interviewees, Jay and Bryson! They're friends from home in Phoenix, Arizona, so we already had some common ground and catching up to do at the start of each interview. Our existing comfort level facilitated more open conversations.

Jay and Byson are my demographic inverses. They are both men, I am not. They are both white, I am not. They create content, I exclusively consume it. 

**How Jay and Bryson differ from each other:**

Jay and Bryson occupy different niches in the realm of content creation: Jay posts photographs for friends and family, while Bryson aims to influence a substantial internet following.  Because my hunch contrasts parasocial interactions, like internet influencing, against intimate connections, I chose a breadth of subjects to cover the giving and receiving end of both types of relationships. Jay and Bryson also represent opposite extremes within the age range of social media users.

### Report

Jay is a retired investment banker who trades and photographs in his free time. He compartmentalizes the way he uses social media into two platforms: Facebook to keep up with friends and family and Twitter to receive updates from financial analysts. Although each platforms offers some support for both types of interaction, Jay prefers to separate the two, because it is “easier to process each one in its own sorted stream.” As a result, Jay sees Facebook as a platform clogged with political disagreements and Twitter as no-nonsense, where many netizens recognize Twitter as equally if not more politically charged. On Facebook, Jay posts landscape and wildlife photography captioned with inspirational thoughts. Beyond people Jay knows personally, he follows Nika Rishtel, a Ukranian photographer; he hopes she interprets his engagement as metric of her content’s geographical reach. On and offline, he curates a persona that “lets people close enough to hurt you, but not devastate you.”  

Jay gave myriad examples that highlight the interplay between social media and real-life interaction and the binary effects they have had on his relationships: either fully positive or fully negative. From Jay’s stories, content categories emerged that he associates with positive, authentic interaction and negative “drama.” Authentic interactions include sharing inspirational thoughts, interacting with an artist’s content, and steps to transition communication offline. In three of four positive stories, Jay transitions an interaction beyond social media: he calls to reconcile with an ex-friend after seeing his Facebook friend request, he visits his high school sweetheart in San Diego after seeing her location update on Facebook, he supports a coworker at her performance after seeing her post about her band on Facebook. “Dramatic” interactions include posting to flaunt wealth, engaging in political arguments, and cyberbullying. Jay suggests cauterizing political opinions from social media, describing his ideal platform as a forum for exchanging inspirational thoughts only.

### Report

The last time I spoke to Bryson was in high school, when content creation was synonymous with his identity; he was “the guy with the YouTube channel.” Since then, he got a job working as a video editor for a family vlogging channel. He briefly dated a girl who was part of the family he worked for, and during that period, his viewership soared – he finally had the audience he wanted. Bryson likes making gaming videos, but his new audience saw him as an additional peephole into the family’s personal life. They demanded more vlogging content, and he obliged at the expense of his passion for content creation, which dwindled rapidly. He took a break from social media entirely when he broke up with his ex-girlfriend, because he received an influx of hate from fans of the family vlog. Bryson believed it was “unhealthy [for his audience] to live vicariously through someone else.” 

As such, Bryson encourages his subscribers to advance past a parasocial relationship and message him personally on Instagram, which has the simultaneous effect of humanizing him as a content creator. Through his conversations, Bryson has sensed many of his followers are “completely disconnected from IRL possibilities [for friendship]” that can evolve from an online community. As a consumer, Bryson limits his engagement to friend’s posts, where he feels like it means something to the creator. Bryson’s most authentic online connections are with the subscribers who remained loyal to him while the content on his channel changed, because they felt compelled by his personality. He argues that YouTube’s algorithm is content-focused, pushing a temporary viewer base to his channel and obligating him to fit inside a niche he feels too big for. 

## Design Opportunities

+ **Online to offline:** Scroll through a feed of activities in your area (e.g., restaurants, cafes, parks), send a date and time-bound invitation to your friends to move the interaction offline. Like Scheduling Assistant in Outlook or Teams, you can see friends’ calendar and send an invitation that coincides with their availability. 
    - Both Jay and Bryson emphasize the importance of transitioning online relationships offline. A platform dedicated to easing this transition takes pressure off phrasing an invitation to hang out with someone new (like Bryson’s subscribers) or rekindle an old connection (like Jay’s ex-girlfriend). 
+ **Personality over content:** A platform that recommends (especially long-form) creators based on compatibility between their personality and the consumer’s values. Uses sentiment analysis or a similar tool to characterize a creator’s online presence and match them to a consumer. 
    - Bryson commented on the volatility of a social media audience, how creators become forced into a niche persona associated with specific types of content to keep subscribers engaged. Binding consumer to creator instead of consumer to content sparks creativity surrounding content formats and humanizes creators.
+ **Sub-feeds:** Scrape the platforms you use for content you like to see and navigate through content sorted into category sub-feeds (e.g., Jay would have a tab for friends and family, photography, and business analytics), all in one place. 
    - Both Jay and Bryson divide functionalities available on all social media platforms exclusively between different platforms, because they benefit from the sense of organization. They could engage with the variety of content related to thier interests available on all platforms, possibly discovering a format they like better, without forgoing order.
